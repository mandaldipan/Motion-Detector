# Motion-Detector

## By Dipan Mandal

This Program uses the **OpenCV** module and **Haar Cascade Classifier** concept to detect any motion happening in front of the camera.
**Haar Cascade Classifier** algorithm was developed/proposed in 2001 by Paul Viola and Michael Jones.
For more details about **Viola-Jones object detection framework**, here is the link:[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viola%E2%80%93Jones_object_detection_framework)
